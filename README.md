### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hironmoy Ray
#### Frontend Web Developer 
![Frontend Web Developer ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hironmoy-ray-148a152aa)

I am an aspiring web developer with a strong focus on frontend technologies, particularly React.js. 

My journey in web development began by establishing a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through which I successfully completed multiple projects, refining my skills along the way.

During my part-time role at a freelance company near my university, I gained practical experience working with React.js.

 I contributed to various projects, developing user interfaces (UI) with Tailwind CSS and working on form UI components to create seamless user experiences.

I have a keen interest in problem-solving with C++, and Iâ€™ve delved into Data Structures and Algorithms to strengthen my programming foundation. 

While my primary expertise is in frontend development, I also have a working knowledge of backend technologies, particularly within the MERN stack.

Skills: REACT JS / JavaScript / HTML / CSS
